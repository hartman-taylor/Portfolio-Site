                            In order to demostrate linear movement in a machine
                            with 2.5 degrees of freedom, I aimed to make a
                            machine that could stack blocks. Initially, I was
                            worried about having to design too many parts, but
                            after thinking it through, I realized if designed
                            properly, I only needed to design 4 parts; I could
                            then use the same parts in multiple different
                            places. I was supplied with aliminium rails and
                            stepper motors, so I designed the parts around the
                            dimensions of those components. All red parts
                            (brackets, carriages, carts) were designed in
                            SolidWorks and 3D printed; Explination of each
                            individual part is on the next page. The set of
                            motors mounted on elevated platforms made from
                            2x4's, control the movement in the horizontal
                            direction; I completed all of the parts for
                            horizontal movement first, to make sure everything
                            worked as planned. I then moved to the vertical
                            axes. The carriages on the horizontal axes attatch
                            to carts with bearings on the bottom in order to
                            smoothly support the vertical axes. Additionally,
                            these carts house the motors used for movement along
                            the vertical axes. All motion is acheived with
                            stepper driven belts mounted to alimunum rails. The
                            blocks are picked up with an electromagnet fashioned
                            out of a bolt wrapped in copper wire; this requires
                            around 3.5 Amps of current from an external power
                            source, which is toggle on and off via relay. This
                            toggling along with all other motor control is done
                            with a microcontroller, commanded with GCode. The
                            final product worked as expected (demonstrated in
                            video to the left). It successfully had 2.5 degrees
                            of freedom, the first two being movement in the
                            horizontal and vertical directions; The third was
                            the toggling of the electromagnet.

                        <b>Cart</b> houses the motors for the vertical axes,
                        along with providing support for the vertical alimunum
                        bars, and mounting points for the bearings which allow
                        for the entire aparatus to slide along the horizontal
                        axes. The idea here was to reduce friction with the
                        ground as much as possible, while holding all the
                        necissary components. The four screw holes secure the
                        motor to the part. Two bearings were mounted on the
                        bottom, using the two holes shown along with a third
                        bearing and hole, which are obstructed in the current
                        view. Althought the wheels should have been built with a
                        bit more support, the part functioned as expected.

                        with a fairly large tolerance due to the uncertainty and
                        inaccuracy of the 3D printed supports. This piece
                        successfully held the axes in place securely, while
                        still having enough tolerance to be slipped on and off

                        it would be easier for wire management and easy of
                        assembly to leave one side open. The part worked as
                        intended and was stong enough to keep the motor from
                        moving undesirably.

                            In order to seal a connection between parts, a
                            gasket is often used. I was supplied with a custom
                            metal part with several holes and pins. I was tasked
                            with the challenge of designing a gasket which fit
                            the metal within a margin of 0.005 inches. I
                            initially thought this would be harder than it was,
                            because I was not aware of the high level of
                            precision of the calipers; After using a pair of
                            calipers to measure and sketch the metal part, I
                            used the measurements in order to construct a
                            corresponding gasket in SolidWorks. After
                            dimensioning the gasket correctly, I manufactured it
                            using three different methods: CNC machining, laser
                            cutting, and 3D printing. The gasket fit the piece
                            within the desired tolerance and feeling around the
                            edges was almost perfectly smooth. The CNC and Laser
                            Cut versions were slightly better than the 3D
                            printed one, simply because the precision of these
                            machines is better than that of a 3D printer;
                            additionally, the PVC is a lot smoother than the
                            extruded PLA.

                            In order to practice casting and molding, I was
                            tasked with making a stamp. I designed the mold for
                            the stamp in SolidWorks then 3D printed it and cast
                            a silicon model with it. After testing the silicon
                            stamp, I designed and 3D printed a two piece
                            enclosure for the silicon. Finally, I attatched the
                            two pieces with glue. The final stamp worked well,
                            as can be seen in the pictures above.

                            I was tasked with making a shape out of clay and
                            then replicating it in plaster. I thought out a plan
                            to make a small box in order to make a mold. The
                            cast the plaster in the mold. Starting off, I formed
                            a bunch of clay into the desired shaped and then
                            submerged it in silicon in order to create a soft
                            mold. After it dried I removed the mold from its
                            foam board container and filled it with plaster to
                            create a copy of the original model. The copy was
                            nearly identical to the original model; the only
                            thing I would improve if I did it again would be to
                            make sure a flat surface was facing the bottom of
                            the mold, in order to avoid loss of features.

                <h2>Heat Tool Design</h2>
                <p>
                    A 20 gauge nichrome wire heats up enough to cut foam when
                    4.3 Amps of current is passed through it. My task was to
                    utilize this fact to make a heat tool which can carve things
                    out of foam. However the wire becomes much too hot to hold
                    and if the ends are touched together it short circuits. To
                    solve these problems I made a heat proof enclosure with an
                    on/off switch. I thought 2 pieces would be ideal, for easy
                    of assembly and repair. The idea of the switch was intended
                    to make handling easier without worry of being shocked while
                    messing with the leads. First I designed a two piece
                    enclosure in SolidWorks. The two pieces attatch with pins
                    and include holes for the wires and switch; this means they
                    can be easily dissassembled, in order to maximize ease of
                    repair and disassembly. I then designed a custom mold to fit
                    in the designated space in the enclosure. After 3D printing
                    the enclosure and mold, I created the main nichrome wire
                    piece by bending 6 inches of nichrome wire into the correct
                    shape and attatching copper wire leads to the ends. I then
                    cast around it in the mold with epoxy. The mold itself is
                    designed to be part of the final product rather than being
                    peeled off. Finally I put all of the components together and
                    soldered the wired connections. It successfully cut through
                    foam after testing. The only part of design I would change
                    if I did it again would be to have supports on both sides of
                    the nichrome loop; this way it would not move around as much
                    when cutting.

                            was to use it to acheive smooth but not circular
                            motion. I built this prototype in MathIllustrations.
                            Although all the joints rotate with constant radii
                            respective to their pins, if a connection is made at
                            an intermidiate point of one of the members, a
                            smooth non-circular motion is successfully acheived,

                            improve upon the previous design, I modeled it in
                            Solidworks by connecting four bars of the correct
                            proportions and then adding a motor in SolidWorks
                            Motion. This sucessfully demonstartes the movement

                            successfullly achieves a similiar result as the 4
                            bar mechanism, but it allows for a more defined
                            range of movement. This can be seen, by picturing a
                            dot on any of the intermediate points of the
                            mechanism.

                            mechanisms. In order to avoid unneccissary
                            complexity, I set out to design a mechanism that
                            could move a bar from the position on the left to
                            the position on the right, when rotated around the
                            center point (F). I completed this task sucessfully,

                            In order to practice mechanism design and create a
                            trashcan that is easily usable from any angle, I
                            aimed to design a trash can with a tray that
                            transfered trash from the top into the can. I had to
                            make sure that the tray would not flip over during
                            the movement process; Additionally I had to make
                            sure the tray did not collide with the can itself
                            and that the connections were all in the body of the
                            trash can. Initially I did not know how to go about
                            this, but I soon realized I just needed to
                            synthesisze a four bar mechanism that reached three
                            key positions. The fourth bar is modeled not as a
                            bar itself but as the distance between the two
                            mounting points on the trash can. In class, I made
                            an initial concept drawing in MathIllustrations,
                            which can be seen below. This functioned relatively
                            well, but some of the lengths needed minor
                            adjustments. After making these adjustments, I began
                            to build the pieces in SolidWorks. To the right is
                            three pictures of the tray in the three key
                            positions I used to contsruct the four bar
                            mechanism. On the far right is the final product
                            with the path of the tray traced out in Motion
                            Study. As can be seen, the product acheived the task
                            sucessfully. Tweaking the lengths ended up being the
                            most time consuming part, as I had a bit of trouble
                            transfering them precisesly from MathIllustrations
                            to SolidWorks.

                            <b>Redesign 1</b> In order to improve upon the
                            existing trash cans in cities like Boston, I set out
                            to redesign a new one that avoided the existing
                            problems. Currenlty many of the trash cans are
                            overflowing with trash, get the solar panels blocked
                            by snow, and do not utilize space effectively. My
                            first redesign features a hinged panel with a lock
                            instead of the "drawer" style present on current
                            trashcans. The flap is locked when not in use in
                            order to keep animals out and trash in. The lock is
                            released with a button on the flap. Additionally
                            this flap can lock when the trashcan is full in
                            order to stop trash overflow.

                            <b>Redesign 2</b> features the same door locking
                            mechanism as redesign 1, except instead of being a
                            button, the release is built into a grip sensor in
                            the handle. Additionally, I added a compactor and
                            underground storage for higher capacity. I made the
                            top of the trashcan slanted in order to discourage
                            trash being placed there in the event that the trash
                            can is full and stop snow from sticking to the top
                            so easily. Lastly, I added a wifi enabled
                            microcontroller that can send the trash can's status
                            to waste management companies, in order to optimize
                            collection routes. With these added features, the
                            existing problems are effectively solved.

                            <b>Hot Plate</b> Certain plastics can be melted at
                            rather low temperatures (~100 degrees Celcius) and
                            then be molded and cooled into a specific shape. The
                            melting process for this plastic often includes
                            having to boil water, submerge the plastic, and
                            remove it after it has softened; this requires a
                            large amount of tools and lengthy clean up process.
                            My goal is to improve the ease of this process. I
                            initially knew that nichrome wire can be used to
                            heat things up, but I thought there should be an
                            insulator in order to stop from burning ones hands.
                            I sketched a possible design (on the right) then
                            began to piece it together. I threaded nichrome wire
                            through a silicon mold in order to make a hotplate.
                            After making an aluminium plate with a non
                            conductive bottom out of foil and tape, I was able
                            to successfully melt the plastic by running current
                            through the nichrome wire and setting the plate on
                            top. The base was not too hot and was moveable with
                            my bare hands. The plastic could be grabbed out of
                            the plate much more easily than out of boiling
                            water.

                            In order to be able to watch videos hands free, I
                            was tasked with making a phone stand. I thought that
                            the simpler the shape the easier it will be to bend
                            acryllic into, so I first scored a sheet of acrylic
                            into roughly a 2x5 inch rectangle; then I used a
                            clamp to hold the piece so I could break along the
                            cuts. After that I used a heat gun to heat up and
                            bend the acrylic into the desired shape. Finally, I
                            used a file to deburr the edges. I placed my phone
                            in the stand and it successfullly held it in the
                            desired postion.

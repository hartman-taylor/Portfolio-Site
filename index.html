                            All red parts (brackets, carriages, carts) were
                            designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed. The set of
                            motors mounted on elevated platforms made from
                            2x4's, control the movement in the horizontal
                            direction. The carriages on these axes attatch to
                            carts with bearings on the bottom in order to
                            smoothly support the vertical axes. Additionally,
                            these carts house the motors used for movement along
                            the vertical axes. All motion is acheived with
                            stepper driven belts mounted to alimunum rails. The
                            blocks are picked up with an electromagnet fashioned
                            out of a bolt wrapped in copper wire; this requires
                            around 3.5 Amps of current from an external power
                            source, which is toggle on and off via relay. This
                            toggling along with all other motor control is done
                            with a microcontroller, commanded with GCode.

                            to create a copy of the original model.

                <h2>Heat Tool Design</h2>
                <p>
                    A 20 gauge nichrome wire heats up enough to cut foam when
                    4.3 Amps of current is passed through it. This fact can be
                    utilized to make a heat tool which can carve things out of
                    foam. However the wire becomes much too hot to hold and if
                    the ends are touched together it short circuits. To solve
                    these problems we can make a heat proof enclosure with an
                    on/off switch. First I designed a two piece enclosure in
                    SolidWorks. The two pieces attatch with pins and include
                    holes for the wires and switch; this means they can be
                    easily dissassembled, in order to maximize ease of repair
                    and disassembly. I then designed a custom mold to fit in the
                    designated space in the enclosure. After 3D printing the
                    enclosure and mold, I created the main nichrome wire piece
                    by bending 6 inches of nichrome wire into the correct shape
                    and attatching copper wire leads to the ends. I then cast
                    around it in the mold with epoxy. The mold itself is
                    designed to be part of the final product rather than being
                    peeled off. Finally I put all of the components together and
                    soldered the wired connections. It successfully cut through
                    foam after testing.

                            <b>Four Bar Mechanism</b> consists of four bars
                            connected by pin joints. Although all the joints
                            rotate with constant radii respective to their pins,
                            if a connection is made at an intermidiate point of
                            one of the members, a smooth non-circular motion can
                            be acheived, as shown in red.

                            but it allows for a more defined range of movement.

                            <b>Hot Plate</b> Certain plastics can be melted at
                            rather low temperatures (~100 degrees Celcius) and
                            then be molded and cooled into a specific shape. The
                            melting process for this plastic often includes
                            having to boil water, submerge the plastic, and
                            remove it after it has softened; this requires a
                            large amount of tools and lengthy clean up process.
                            To improve upon this, I threaded nichrome wire
                            through a silicon mold in order to make a hotplate.
                            After making an aluminium plate with a non
                            conductive bottom out of foil and tape, I was able
                            to successfully melt the plastic by running current
                            through the nichrome wire and setting the plate on
                            top.

                            to waste management companies, in order to optimize

                            I first scored a sheet of acrylic into roughly a 2x5
                            inch rectangle; then I used a clamp to hold the
                            piece so I could break along the cuts. After that I
                            used a heat gun to heat up and bend the acrylic into
                            the desired shape. Finally, I used a file to deburr
                            the edges.

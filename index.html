                            All red parts (brackets, carriages, carts) were
                            designed in SolidWorks and 3D printed. The set of
                            motors mounted on elevated platforms made from
                            2x4's, control the movement in the horizontal
                            direction. The carriages on this axis attatch to
                            carts with bearings on the bottom in order to
                            smoothly support the vertical axes. Additionally,
                            these carts house the motors used for movement along
                            the vertical axes. All motion is acheived with
                            stepper driven belts mounted to alimunum rails. The
                            blocks are picked up with an electromagnet fashioned
                            out of a bolt wrapped in copper wire; this requires
                            around 3.5 Amps of current from an external power
                            source, which is toggle on and off via relay. This
                            toggling along with all other motor control is done
                            with a microcontroller, commanded with GCode.

                <h2>Heat Tool Design</h2>
                <p>
                    A 20 gauge nichrome wire heats up enough to cut foam when
                    4.3 Amps of current is passed through it. This fact can be
                    utilized to make a heat tool which can carve things out of
                    foam. However the wire becomes much too hot to hold and if
                    the ends are touched together it short circuits. To solve
                    these problems we can make a heat proof enclosure with an
                    on/off switch. First I designed a two piece enclosure in
                    SolidWorks. The two pieces attatch with pins and incluse
                    holes for the wires and switch, in order to maxamize ease of
                    repair and disassembly. I then designed a custom mold to fit
                    in the designated space in the enclosure. After 3D printing
                    the enclosure and mold, I created the main nichrome wire
                    piece by bending 6 inches of nichrome wire into the correct
                    shape and attatching copper wire leads to the ends. I then
                    cast around it in the mold with epoxy. The mold itself is
                    designed to be part of the final product rather than being
                    peeled off. Finally I put all of the components together and
                    soldered the wired connections. It successfully cut through
                    foam after testing.

                            This mechanism consists of four bars connected by
                            pin joints. Although all the joints rotate in a
                            circle respective to other joints, if a connection
                            is made in the center of one of the members, a
                            smooth non-circular motion can be acheived, as shown
                            in red.

                            Certain plastics can be melted at rather low
                            temperatures (~100 degrees Celcius) and then be
                            molded and cooled into a specific shape. The melting
                            process for this plastic often includes having to
                            boil water, submerge the plastic, and remove it
                            after it has softened; this requires a large amount
                            of tools and lengthy clean up process. To improve
                            upon this, I threaded nichrome wire through a
                            silicon mold in order to make a hotplate. After
                            making an aluminium plate with a non conductive
                            bottom out of foil and tape, I was able to
                            successfully melt the plastic by running current
                            through the nichrome wire and setting the plate on
                            top.

                            I first scored a sheet of acrylic into roughly a 2x5
                            inch rectangle; then I used a clamp to break along
                            the cuts. After that I used a heat gun to heat up
                            and bend the acrylic into the desired shape.
                            Finally, I used a file to deburr the edges.
